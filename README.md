* Launch Spotify directly from the skinâ€™s Spotify icon. If Spotify is not running, the skin minimizes back to the icon.
* Hovering over the album cover reveals the **Controls Panel** and **Song Info Panel**, or only the **Song Info Panel**, depending on the selected skin.
* Clicking the album cover or details panel opens the main Spotify window.
* Playback controls include: **Previous Track**, **Play/Pause**, **Next Track**, and **Repeat**.
* Adjust volume by scrolling the mouse wheel over the skin or using a two-finger swipe gesture on a trackpad.
* Right-clicking the skin toggles **Mute/Unmute**.
* A progress bar around the album cover visually tracks song playback.
* Both the progress bar and the song title dynamically adopt an accent color extracted from the album cover.

## Spotify Web
* To use it with Spotify Web, install the [WebNowPlaying](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/webnowplaying/jfakgfcdgpghbbefmdfjkbdlibjgnbli) extension.

###### * Minimize the Spotify window rather than close it to work properly.
###### * It only works with the Spotify desktop app; the web player is not yet supported.
